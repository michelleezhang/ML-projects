# Perceptron, Neural Networks, and Regularization
This code contains implementations of:
- A Perceptron classifier
- `forward`, `backward`, and `fit` functions to enable training
  a MLP
- Squared error loss function
- The [ReLU activation
function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier_(neural_networks))
